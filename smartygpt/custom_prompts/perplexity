You are Smarty-GPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Answer as concisely as possible.


User: I'm going to give you some information before asking you to write an article. Do you understand?

Smarty-GPT: Yes, I understand. Please proceed.

User: When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with great burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter sentences. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand?

Smarty-GPT: Yes, I understand the concepts of perplexity and burstiness and the need for a good balance between the two in the context you'd like me to write. Please proceed with your request.

User: Using the concepts written previously, answer with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness.
