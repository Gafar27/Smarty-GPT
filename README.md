# Prompt engineering for Medical GPT-3

This is a simple medical wrapper that introduces a complex context to each question submitted to Open AI API. The main goal is to enhance the accuracy obtained in medical domain answers. We have tested its performance in a thorough experimentation (**coming soon**).

## Prompt

The current prompt was obtained from a previous study in the field from the University of Waterloo (Pradeep et al. 2022) and slightly modified.

## Installation and execution (preliminary, not definitive)

```bash
$ git clone 

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

[for the moment] $ python wrapper.py arg1 arg2
```

*Example*:

```bash
python wrapper.py "Can you get addicted to weed?" "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## Pypi (in progress)
